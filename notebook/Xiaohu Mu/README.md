## 2025-02-17-Discussion with Professor Fliflet
Professor Fliflet gave us suggestions to implement the ideas we mentioned in our proposal during the proposal review. We came with the idea to use the YOLOV5 model as our baseline and use it to recognize and classify tools from different categories. We planed to train the model first on our laptop then transplant the program to raspberry pi. We also decided to use the LCD screen to show item status on the bench and drawer.
## 2025-02-27-PCB Update
We came with our initial design of PCB. In this design, we included the STM32 microprocessor, LED, and buzzer.
